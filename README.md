This is Project 02 for IS-2043-004!
I will be following this tutorial: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners

Steps:

Created task.sh and added the #!/usr/bin/bash

Created hello-world.sh

Created backup.sh using c/Users/solom/OneDrive/Desktop/UTSA instead of the directory in the tutorial

Created welcome.sh

Tried to update backup.sh but had issues where the echo wouldn't work and I had to force exit. When I check the directory in file explorer, the tar.gz file is created.

I was able to update backup.sh to remove the stderr meessage but I didn't fix the backup.sh

I updated backup.sh with the new code but it still made me force exit.
